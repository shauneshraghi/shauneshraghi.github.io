Thank you for visiting my blog. I am a recent doctoral graduate from Georgia Tech in the school of bioengineering. Bioengineering is a pretty broad discipline of study, but I fit into the mechanical engineering side of it in Dr. Suman Das's [direct digital manufacturing lab][lab]. 

My thesis focused on [additive manufacturing][wiki], aka 3D printing, of scaffolds for tissue engineering. This involved everything from developing some of the machines to build the scaffolds to characterizing properties of the scaffolds. If you're interested in finding my thesis, it should be posted [here][thesis] sometime soon.

I want to use this blog to go over some of the research I did during my PhD as well as discuss things I find interesting.
