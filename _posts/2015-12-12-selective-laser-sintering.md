I published [two papers][scholar] on Selective Laser Sintering (SLS) of Polycaprolactone (PCL) and Hydroxyapatite (HA) composites a few years ago. 

SLS is an additive manufacturing process where powder is heated close to its melting temperature and a computer controlled laser is used to selectively melt the powder in a pattern corresponding to slices from a CAD model. A roller or scraper is then used to deposit a layer on top of the exposed layer. This process is repeated layer-by-layer until the highest object is finished.

PCL was used because it is a biodegradable polymer with a Young's Modulus in the lower range of trabecular bone. Hydroxyapatite is a bioactive ceramic that was used as a filler for reinforcement at loading fractions up to 30%. 

A design of experiments approach was taken to optimize the SLS processing parameters (laser power, scan speed, powder temperature, etc.) in order to create fully dense parts that were mechanically sound.

A first-principles computational model was developed to predict the mechanical properties of the scaffolds for an arbitrary loading of HA. A random packing model was employed to simulate the packing of HA in a PCL matrix. This packing model was then used to create a micromechanical model to determine the bulk properties of the composites, and finally a macromechanical model was developed to determine the effective properties of the scaffolds.

The next step for this work is the development of patient-specific and tissue-specific tissue engineering constructs with tailored properties.
